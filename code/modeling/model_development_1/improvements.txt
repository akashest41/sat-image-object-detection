More data needed for the following scenarios:
	1. residential buildings: small roughly squared and somewhat damaged and somewhat isolated, completely destroyed buildings (both big and small), near roads with cars, do less data augmentation, small bounding boxes at the edge, brighter white undamaged residential buildings
	2. commercial buildings: with empty parking lots, needs more data augmentation, less small squared commercial buildings and more medium sized commercial buildings, completely destroyed big lots, non square shaped, how to make sure that it does not cover smaller residential buildings within it?, small bounding boxes at the edge especially those showing a very small portion at the edge, cluster of commercial buildings likely to be a commercial building as well, be consistent with whether you are splitting a commercial building into multiple subbuildings within a complex or marking the whole complex as it is
